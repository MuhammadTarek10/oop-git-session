# Git

It's a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.

## Concepts

### Working Directory

Your local folder where you are working on your project.

### Index (Staging Area)

A place where you can group files and prepare them to be committed.

### Repository

A place where Git stores all the versions of your project.

### Commits

A snapshot of your project at a given time.

### Branches

A way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

### Merges

A way to put a branch's changes into another branch.

### Rebase

A way to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit.

### Stash

A way to save changes that you don't want to commit immediately.

### Tags

A way to mark a specific point in Git history as being important.

## Commands

### Init

Initialize a local Git repository.

```bash
git init
```

### Add

Add file contents to the index.

```bash
git add <file>
```

### Commit

Record changes to the repository.

```bash
git commit -m "<message>"
```

### Status

Show the working tree status.

```bash
git status
```

### Log

Show commit logs.

```bash
git log
```

### Diff

Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.

```bash
git diff
```

### Branch

List, create, or delete branches.

```bash
git branch
```

### Checkout

Switch branches or restore working tree files.

```bash
git checkout <branch>
```

### Merge

Join two or more development histories together.

```bash
git merge <branch>
```

### Rebase

Reapply commits on top of another base tip.

```bash
git rebase <branch>
```

### Stash

Stash the changes in a dirty working directory away.

```bash
git stash
git stash apply
```

### Tag

Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG.

```bash
git tag
```

## Concepts

### Remotes

A remote repository is one hosted somewhere other than our local machine. We can add remotes with `git remote add`, and set up _tracking branches_ to track differences between our local and remote repositories.

### Pull

To get changes from a remote repository to a local one.

### Push

To get changes from a local repository to a remote one.

### Fetch

To get changes from a remote repository to a local one without merging them.

### Clone

To copy a remote repository to a local one.

### Fork

To create a personal copy of someone else's project.

### Pull Request

To request that someone reviews and merges your changes to a project.

### Merge Conflict

When Git can't automatically resolve differences in a merge.

### Gitignore

A file that tells Git to ignore other files or directories.

### License

An open source license tells others what they can and can't do with your code.

### README

A file where you can tell others what your project does and how to use it.

## Commands

### Clone

Create a local copy of a remote repository.

```bash
git clone <url>
```

### Remote

Manage set of tracked repositories.

```bash
git remote add <name> <url>
```

### Fetch

Download objects and refs from another repository.

```bash
git fetch
```

### Pull

Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch.

```bash
git pull
```

### Push

Update remote refs along with associated objects.

```bash
git push
```

# Notes

## Naming Conventions

Team should agree on a way of naming everything, variables, functions, etc. (i.e. camelCase, snake_case, etc.) and stick to it.

## Master Branch

The master branch is the "default" branch when you create a repository. Use other branches for development and merge them back to the master branch upon completion.

You don't change contents of master branch, all changes to it should be merged from a well tested branch. **(unless you know what you are doing)**

## Branch Names

Branch names should be descriptive, meaningful, have no spaces, and use dashes to separate words. (i.e. **new-branch** not new_branch or newbranch)

## Merge Conflicts

When Git can't automatically resolve differences in a merge, it creates a merge conflict. You can resolve merge conflicts by editing the files that Git couldn't merge. After you resolve the conflicts, you can add and commit the changes.

## HEAD

it's a pointer to the current branch reference, which is in turn a pointer to the last commit you made or the last commit that was checked out into your working directory.

## Commit Messages

You must write a descriptive commit message for every commit. Don't write a commit message like "fix" or "changes". Write a message that describes what you did in the commit. (i.e. "fix bug in login page" or "add new feature to dashboard")

## .gitignore

It's a file that tells Git to ignore other files or directories. You can use it to ignore files generated by your operating system, text editor, etc. You can also use it to ignore files in your repository that contain sensitive information like passwords or API keys.

## requirements.txt

It's a file that contains a list of all the Python packages that your project depends on. You can generate it by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your project's directory.
